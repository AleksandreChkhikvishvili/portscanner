this portscanner is written with the python3 in kali linux, I have changed the origianl script and added some of my lines that I wanted in there to make it unique, for example this portscanner scans for the open ports and gives us an output of what possibly that port is used for, it only scans for the open ports it willnot scan for open ports, Also I have added a message at the beggining of the script and and a message at the end of the script with my name, Thank you for reading.
