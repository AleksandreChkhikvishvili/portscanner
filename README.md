this port scanner is written with the python3 in kali linux, I have changed the origianl script and added some of my lines that I wanted in there to make it unique, for example this port scanner scans for the open ports and gives us an output of what possibly that port is used for, it only scans for the open ports it willnot scan for closed ports, Also I have added a message at the beggining of the script and and a message at the end of the script with my name, Thank you for reading.
PLEASE make sure to have python3 otherwise you won't be able to run the script.
